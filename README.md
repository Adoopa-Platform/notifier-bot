# Notifier Bot

This bot is a serverless background function that listens to events from a smart contract and for each newly created offer it posts a cast to tag and notify the receiver of the offer. It uses the Neynar SDK to interact with Warpcast and the ethers.js library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
